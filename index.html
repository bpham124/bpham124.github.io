    <p> Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a style of rock music that
      emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s. In this
      instance, the word "alternative" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music.  <p>

  <p> Punk rock (or "punk") is a rock music genre that developed in the mid-1970s in the United States, 
    United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as 
    "proto-punk" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. </p>
